# Fireball - A Burning Ball
Fireball is a python game using pygame where a player has to avoid a fireball. The longer the player stays alive, the more points the player gets.

## How does the game work?
 - Player starts the game and there will be the player and a fireball initially.  
 
 - Player will dodge the ball using the keyboard arrow keys, while the fireball will change positions randomly to try to follow the player.  

 - After a specific time according to the levels (Easy|Medium|Hard) more fireballs will be added to the game.  
 - If the player collides with any of the fireballs, the game ends and it displays the total score.
